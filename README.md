# Responsive_Dashboard
This is a responsive dashboard fit for a variety of uses. It was designed using the mobile first approach and it is responsive both on destop and mobile devices.
The dashboard also allows a user to personalise the theme by changing to their prefered color; three dashboard theme options are provided.
The technologies used for this project are html for markup, Bootstrap (there is no particular reason why i chose to bootstrap other than for practice), SASS and javascript.
